Here is my first entry into this. Confession: kind of thought this would be a good idea to get my github commit log up, but I kind of see a broad appeal to journaling professional efforts using markdown and git.

Today... I spent the whole day chasing a bug with a custom view modifier I wrote that does a custom UIKit modal presentation in the background. The problem wasn't with my custom view modifier logic. It was actually in my view model, which was getting recreated over and over. This reset state but worse sent all my old method calls to a previous version of the view model. 

Yikes.
